# Python Classes

imagine you are tasked to implement an employee database app

superclasses are listed in parentheses in a class header
classes inherit attributes from their superclasses
instances inherit attributes from all accessible classes
each object.attribute reference invokes a new, independent search

# Dictionaries as Classes?

attributes of namespace objects usually implemented as dictionaries
because of this model, an attribute can be fetched by dictionary indexing or attribute notation
(both have their roles)
